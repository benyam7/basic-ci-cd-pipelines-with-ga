### Lesson Title: Basic CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

#### Lesson Overview ‚úèÔ∏è

In modern software development, delivering reliable features quickly is essential. Imagine a team releasing a new feature daily to a global e-commerce platform‚Äîwithout breaking anything. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, powered by GitHub Actions, enable development teams to integrate changes frequently, run automated tests to catch bugs early, and seamlessly deploy successful updates to users.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll start with a simple scenario: you push code changes to your repository, and within minutes, your tests have run, and the build is ready for deployment. We‚Äôll move step-by-step from a basic CI workflow that checks code on every push to a more robust pipeline that can be extended into a full CD process. Along the way, you‚Äôll see how this approach reduces integration issues, speeds feedback, and keeps users happy.

#### Learning Objectives üìì

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Explain the core principles and real-world benefits of CI/CD.
2. Configure and run a basic GitHub Actions workflow for a Java project.
3. Integrate automated testing into a CI workflow to ensure quality code
4. Trigger builds and tests automatically upon code pushes or pull requests.
5. Understand how to extend CI workflows to include basic deployment steps (CD).

#### Key Definitions and Examples üîë

##### Concept 1: CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)

###### Definition:

CI/CD is a development practice where code changes are integrated and tested frequently (CI), and successful builds are automatically or easily deployed (CD). This ensures high quality and rapid release cycles.

###### Real-World Example:

Picture a social media app that updates features daily. CI runs tests immediately after code pushes, catching issues before they reach users. If tests pass, a CD step might deploy to a staging site, and once approved, to production‚Äîoften with no downtime.

##### Concept 2: GitHub Actions

###### Definition:

GitHub Actions is a platform integrated into GitHub that automates tasks like building, testing, and deploying code based on events (e.g., a push or pull request).

###### Example:

A common GitHub Actions workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) can be configured to run Java tests every time code is pushed. If the tests pass, the workflow might proceed to build the project and optionally deploy a test version of the application to a cloud environment.

A GitHub Actions workflow triggers each time you push code to main or events you have set up to listen and trigger the workflow too. It checks out the code, sets up Java, runs tests, and if successful, packages the application‚Äîproviding immediate feedback on code quality.
